# List of ProcessWire tags/versions used for testing.
#
# It doesn't have to be exact version number.
#
# For each tag/version will be found latest matching
# existing tag (e.g. 3.0 -> 3.0.42).
#
# Versions are tested in the specified order.
#
# Minimal supported version is 2.5.
#
# Example:
#     testTags:
#         - "2.5"
#         - "2.6"
#         - "2.7"
#         - "3.0"

# Copy source files into ProcessWire's' installation before testing.
#
# It is a list of objects with `destination` and `source` properties.
#
# Destination paths are relative to ProcessWire's installation root.
#
# Source paths are relative to the config file's parent directory.
#
# Sources can either be a single string or an array of strings.
# If the source is a string, file to file copy is used.
# If the source is an array of strings, the destination
# is considered to be a directory where all sources are copied into.
#
# If source item is a directory, it will be copied recursively.
#
# Example:
#     copySources:
#         - destination: "site/templates/HomeTemplate.php"
#           source: "src/templates/home.php"
#         - destination: "site/modules/Module"
#           source:
#               - "Libs"
#               - "Module.module"

# Command to execute a test suite.
#
# Path to the ProcessWire installation will be in `PW_PATH` environment variable.

# Example:
#     testCmd: "vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap vendor/autoload.php tests/Test.php"
#/
testCmd: "echo test"

##
# Test runner can wait and ask the user what to do
# after each test suite against a ProcessWire instance is completed.
#
# Possible values are:
# 'never' - never wait (default)
# 'onFailure' - wait when tests failed
# 'always' - always wait
